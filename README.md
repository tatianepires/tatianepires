# Hello there

- I work with software development since 2007. :woman_technologist:
- I was already creating web pages before starting college; so diving into PHP, HTML and CSS seemed a very logical choice. :vulcan_salute:
- I'm passionate about WordPress since my first blog. :computer:
- My website is [tatianepires.com.br](https://tatianepires.com.br).
- I have built WordPress sites for a few of the companies I have previously worked for.

# Smart Coding

- Now I run my own company developing WordPress websites to companies of all sizes and industries: [smartcoding.dev](https://smartcoding.dev)

# Running, gaming, reading, ...

- Running and cycling are my favorite outdoor activities.
- Some of my favorite games :video_game: are Horizon Forbidden West, Hollow Knight, and Beat Saber.
- I like to read comics, Supergirl :superhero_woman: and Superman are my favorites.
